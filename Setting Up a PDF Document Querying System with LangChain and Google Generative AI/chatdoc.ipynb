The simplest way to overcome resistance is to educate the people who  \\nembrace  change.  \\nKotter (2019) asserts that people's low tolerance for change is the cause of their opposition to it. In  \\nthis situation,  the leader  should  work  to persuade  and convince  people  to accept  the change.  \\nAccording to McCartney (2005), success in an organization is a result of good management and  \\nleadership.

Senior  \\n(2002) claims that organizational change is crucial, and managing it becomes a necessary managerial  \\ncompetence.  It is backed  by (Cicmil,  2006),  who  recommended  that managers  engage  in activities  that \\ngo beyond the conventional control agenda and take advantage of their knowledge and capacity to  \\nlead organizational change. Another study (Crawford, 2014) also mentioned that managers should  \\nengage employees from the beginning to see initiatives as their own and not do a thing because of  \\nbeing told. It also will be promoted a sense of belongingness in the organization where the goal is to  \\nachieve the organization's objective. It is supported by (Abdul -Nasser, 2011) nor mative commitment  \\nis an emotional obligation towards the organization. Previous empirical studies have also shown that  \\naffective  and normative  commitment  will promote  an essential  support  behaviour.  The word  \\nmanipulates is defined as handling or controlling skilfully. There are two types of manipulation which  \\nare persuasion  and coercion . The manager  must  keep  the team  engaged  and motivated.  According  to \\n(Kotter, 2019), a lead change required a group to work together as a team. Kotter and Schlesinger  \\nsuggest the effective way to manipulate is to co -opt with the resister. It can be done by selecting the  \\nresister  and making  them  a part of the change  agent.  (Kotter,  1995)  also suggested  empowering  others  \\nto act on the shared purpose. When the subordinates face difficulties facing new changes, it's the  \\nleader's  job to motivate and  resolve  them.  But when  there  is no resolution  to the problem,  a manager  \\ncan encounter  resistance  by offering  incentives  to them.  Research  on behaviour  suggested  that leader  \\nbehaviour, including autocratic, democratic, or lazier faire (Gilley, 2009) works best when the resistor  \\nis in the position of power. Thus, the employee union may come out with agreements and negotiate  \\nwith  the management  regarding  pay and reimbursements,  production  processes,  equipment,  \\nmaterials,  working  environmental  conditions,  leaves,  vacations,  and other  grievances.  \\nCONCLUSION  \\nCompany  AB Currier  Service  can achieve  the desired  goal  with  a plan  before  changes  are implemented.  \\nChanges implemented gradually with the involvement of the impacted groups are more likely to  \\nincrease employee comprehension and commitment.
